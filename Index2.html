		<h4>
			Aristocratic Upbringing
		</h4>
		<p>
			British royalty Princess Diana Spencer was born
			on July 1, 1961, near Sandringham, England.
			Diana, Princess of Wales, was one of the most
			adored members of the British royal family.
			She was the daughter of Edward John Spencer,
			Viscount Althorp, and Frances Ruth Burke Roche,
			Viscountess Althorp (later known as the
			Honorable Frances Shand Kydd).
		<br><br>
			
			Her parents divorced when Diana was young,
			and her father won custody of the children.
			Following her initial education at home,
			Diana attended Riddlesworth Hall School
			and then West Heath School.
		<br><br>
			She became Lady Diana Spencer after her
			father inherited the title of Earl Spencer in 1975.
			Although she was known for her shyness while
			growing up, she did show an interest in music and dancing.
			Diana also had a great fondness for children.
		<br><br>
			After attending finishing school at Institut
			Alpin Videmanette in Switzerland,
			she moved to London. She began working with
			children, eventually becoming an assistant
			at Young England Kindergarten.

		<h4>
			Marriage to Prince Charles
		</h4>
		<p>
		Diana was no stranger to the British royal family, having reportedly played with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward
		as a child while her family rented Park House, an estate owned by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1977, she became reacquainted
		with their older brother,  Prince Charles, who was 13 years her senior.
	<br><br>
		As the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles was usually the subject of media attention, and his courtship of Diana
		was no exception. The press and the public were fascinated by this seemingly odd couple—the reserved, garden-loving prince
		and the shy young woman with an interest in fashion and popular culture.
	<br><br>	
		When the couple married on July 29, 1981, the ceremony was broadcast on television around the world,
		with millions of people tuning in to see what many considered to be the wedding of the century.

	<h4>
		Family Life and Divorce
	</h4>
	<p>
	On June 21, 1982, Diana and Charles had their first child: Prince William Arthur Philip Louis. He was joined by a brother,
	Prince Henry Charles Albert David—known widely as "Prince Harry"—more than two years later, on September 15, 1984.	
<br><br>
	Initially overwhelmed by her royal duties and the intense media coverage of nearly every aspect of her life, she began to
	develop and pursue her own interests. Diana served as a strong supporter of many charities and worked to help the homeless,
	people living with HIV and AIDS and children in need.
<br><br>	
	Unfortunately, the fairy tale wedding of Princess Diana and Prince Charles did not lead to a happily-ever-after marriage.
	The two became estranged over the years, and there were reports of infidelities from both parties. During their union,
	Diana struggled with depression and bulimia.
<br>
	The couple's separation was announced in December 1992 by British Prime Minister
	John Major, who read a statement from the royal family to the House of Commons. The divorce was finalized in 1996.
