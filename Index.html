	Diana's Style & Her Wedding Dress
	</h1>
	
	<p>
	Princess Diana was the original monarch who ruled the art of royal dressing,
	long before Kate Middleton and her cool fashion brands came along. After all,
	she seamlessly embraced Royal etiquette, all the while setting her
	own fashion rules, like not wearing gloves on official visits, starting
	this trainer trend and single-handedly making this Dior handbag one of
	the most coveted in the world.
