		<h3>Diana: In Her Own Words</h3>
		<p>
			is a television documentary that was broadcast on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2017.
			The film includes footage of the late Diana, Princess of Wales discussing aspects of her personal life,
			including her marriage to Prince Charles which was recorded during conversations she had with a voice
			coach in 1992 and 1993.
		<br><br>
			In July 2017, it emerged that Channel 4 planned to broadcast the documentary in the run up to the 20th
			anniversary of the death of Diana. On 30 July, The Mail on Sunday reported that the Princess's brother,
			Earl Spencer had urged Channel 4 not to broadcast the tapes of his sister amid concerns it would cause
			distress to her children. 
		<br>
			His concerns were subsequently echoed by Royal commentators and friends of the
			late princess, including Rosa Monckton, who intended to write to the broadcaster urging them not to show
			the footage, which she said "doesn't belong in the public domain".
		<br><br>
			The documentary drew a mixed reaction from critics, as well as giving Channel 4 their largest overnight
			ratings for over a year. Figures indicated the film was watched by an average audience of 3.5 million,
			peaking at 4.1 million.

			"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."
		</h3>
	
		<p>
			Journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama. The interview
			was broadcast on 20 November 1995. The Princess discussed her and her husband's extramarital affairs.
		<br><br>
			Referring to Charles's relationship with Camilla, she said: "Well, there were three of us in
			this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability
			for kingship.
		<br><br>
			Authors Tina Brown, Sally Bedell Smith and Sarah Bradford support Diana's admission
			in the interview that she had suffered from depression, "rampant bulimia" and had engaged numerous
			times in the act of self mutilation; the show's transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental
			health problems, including that she had "hurt (her) arms and legs".
		<br><br>
			The combination of illnesses
			from which Diana herself said that she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she
			had borderline personality disorder.

			The interview proved to be the tipping point. On 20 December, Buckingham Palace announced that
			the Queen had sent letters to the Prince and Princess of Wales, advising them to divorce.
		<br><br>
			The Queen's move was backed by the Prime Minister and by senior Privy Counsellors, and,
			according to the BBC, was decided after two weeks of talks. Charles formally agreed to the
			divorce in a written statement soon after.
		<br><br>
			In February 1996, the Princess announced her agreement
			after negotiations with the Prince and representatives of the Queen, irritating Buckingham Palace
			by issuing her own announcement of the divorce agreement and its terms.
		<br><br>
			In July 1996, the couple
			agreed on the terms of their divorce. This followed shortly after the Princess's accusation
			that the Prince's personal assistant Tiggy Legge-Bourke had aborted the Prince's child, after
			which Legge-Bourke instructed her attorney Peter Carter-Ruck to demand an apology.
		<br>
			Diana's secretary Patrick Jephson resigned shortly before the story broke,
			later writing that the Princess had "exulted in accusing Legge-Bourke of having had an abortion".
